# Permuted-Isotonic-Regression for State Trace Analysis

State-Trace Analysis (STA) is an emerging method for investigating the question: How many latent processes determine the performance of cognitive abilities? However, statistical testing procedures within the framework of STA have only recently been developed and are still few in number. A novel and promising procedure among these is Permuted Isotonic Regression for state-trace (PIRST; Benjamin et al., 2019) - a nonparametric algorithm based on isotonic regression. This paper reveals application problems of the procedure and subsequently introduces a further development that addresses these issues. This includes a typical significance test with a p-value. The extended PIRST is then examined in detail within the framework of a comprehensive simulation study. In this study, the strengths and weaknesses of the procedure are evaluated through ROC, sensitivity, and specificity analyses. Finally, concrete application recommendations are given, and a code template for the R statistical software is provided, which enables the direct application of the procedure
